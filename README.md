#Portfolio Website

This repository holds the code for my [personal portfolio website](studentoftheworld.herokuapp.com). The site itself was created using Python, [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/), [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and hosted with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).
