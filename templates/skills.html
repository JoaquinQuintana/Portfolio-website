            My background is in biomedical research with a deep knowledge of advanced imaging techniques and drug discovery. Prior to returning to school I was the microscopy specialist for the University of Colorado where I helped manage a facility which housed state of the art automated optical instruments. From my past position I became quite comfortable with Matlab and have developed a strong background in Python from my Applied Computer Science degree. For my day to day activities I primarily utilize Linux.
